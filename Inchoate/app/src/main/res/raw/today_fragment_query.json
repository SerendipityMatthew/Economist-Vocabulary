They stayed in a cottage separate from his parents, sister and teenage nieces; but if the couple were incapacitated by illness, the relatives could look after their four-year-old son.",

The first is of the political project Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings built together. The voters who most wanted to “take back control” and then to “get Brexit done”—older, northern, working class—are among those who most assiduously followed the imperative to “stay home”. Conventional politicians, Mr Cummings wrote in his long, fiery blogs, regard voters with contempt, are deaf to the anger brought about by scandals and unable to fire incompetent officials. Yet this weekend the pair appeared strangely unaware of the upset brought about by Mr Cummings’s trip.",

Free-thinking ministers have been pushed out, including Sajid Javid, a former finance minister, as have some of Downing Street’s more talented political aides. Mr Johnson’s apparent willingness to suffer so much damage to retain him is striking; Mr Cummings emerges from the crisis a more underwhelming figure, and perhaps now a more vulnerable one.",

Stephen Reicher, an adviser to the government’s scientific committee on behaviour during the pandemic, said the affair would undermine the public’s adherence to restrictions. Mr Johnson has warned that any unwinding of restrictions will need to be slow and cautious, given the risk of a second spike in infections. At a separate press conference shortly after Mr Cummings’s, he announced some new easing measures, such as the reopening of street markets from June 1st. The prime minister urged the public to “remember the basics” of social distancing and self-isolation. When Mr Johnson’s most important aide stands accused of ignoring the rules, what chance that the public will heed his exhortations?",

But a recent paper, by Edwin Hu of New York University and Dermot Murphy of the University of Illinois at Chicago, casts doubt on that claim. NYSE’s hybrid auction structure allows floor traders to submit their last orders of the day up to ten seconds before the market’s close, whereas those coming through electronically have to make theirs ten minutes prior to its end. Mr Hu and Mr Murphy find this gives floor traders an advantage in end-of-day auctions. Unsurprisingly, they conclude, the auctions have become more efficient since moving entirely online.",

NYSE, with Cboe and Nasdaq—two other American exchange operators—closed its options-trading floor in March. Arguably, the pit with the most impact on prices is the “red ring” of the London Metals Exchange, one of the last of its kind in Europe. Even at the LME, most volume has traded electronically in recent years. But five-minute “open outcry” sessions interspersed through the day—during which the ring’s participants shout and signal offers at each other—help determine prices in the global industrial-metals market. On March 23rd, after 143 years, the LME moved its price-setting mechanism to its electronic trading system as well.",

Last year it conducted a fortunately timed three-month trial to price nickel electronically, which helped to smooth the switch. Still, ring traders disliked the system during the trial, struggling to lock in their preferred prices for their clients. Some have tried to mimic the ring by trading by phone via the exchange’s inter-office market. \"Although we've shown things work well without the ring,” Matthew Chamberlain, the exchange’s chief executive, told Reuters last week, “Things work well with the ring as well.”",

Under strict lockdowns, economies tend to operate at about 60% capacity, analysis from Goldman Sachs suggests. But as they are eased, that figure rises to 90%. Many offices and factories reopen—but not all do, and people, scared of being infected, are likely to shun many social activities. Unemployment is structurally higher, and is particularly concentrated in occupations which rely on plenty of face-to-face contact. According to one estimate, if Americans chose to avoid person-to-person proximity of the length of an arm or less, occupations worth approximately 10% of national output would become unviable.",

The 90% economy will undoubtedly be characterised by relief, fellow feeling, and newly felt or expressed esteem for those who have worked to keep people safe. But the term depicts a more solitary and less fun sort of society—the sort of place where the office is open but the pub isn’t. A range of real-time data backs up this thesis. Analysis by Tang Jie of Peking University finds that weekday subway trips in China have recovered faster than weekend ones (see left-hand chart), suggesting that people are more prepared to travel for work than for pleasure. Sales of instant noodles, savoured by homebodies, have rocketed, whereas beer sales are doing far less well.",

The length of his internment depended on the course of the city-state’s war with his native Venice. But he did not waste it. “Rather than idle away time he decided to put together this book,” explains the prologue of “The Travels” (in Nigel Cliff’s translation).

Mile-long walls enclose a park filled with roe deer and white stags. The account of the Great Khan’s summer abode at Shangdu—built of bamboo canes tied with silk, and dismantled and moved at the Khan’s whim—inspired the “stately pleasure-dome” in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Xanadu.",

On his deathbed, when asked for the umpteenth time to own up to his fibs, he is said to have responded: “I have not told half of what I saw.”",
